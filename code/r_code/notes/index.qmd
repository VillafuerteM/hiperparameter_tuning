# Objective {.unnumbered}

The objective of this project is to explore and test the performance of different hiperparameter tuning techniques for linear models, tree based models and neural networks. The aim is to show the use of each technique, determine their pros and cons and leave a functional code that can be used as a base for future projects.

These notes assume that you have previous knowledge on linear models, tree based models, neural networks, their parameters and hiperparameters, and model fitting. It is recommended that you go through some bibliography about these topics. Nonetheless, the notes include a brief introduction to each topic.
