# Hiperparameter Tuning Techniques
 
 ## Objective
This project aims to compare different methods for hiperparameter tuning for different models. Specifically, we will compare the following methods:
- Grid Search
- Random Search
- Bayesian Optimization
- Genetic Algorithm

For the following models:
- Linear regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Neural network

## Environment
The project is developed in both Python and R.
The R environment is defined in the `renv.lock` file. To create the environment, run the following command:
```bash
Rscript -e 'renv::restore()'
```

For Python, everything was developed in a conda environment. The environment file is in the root of the repository. To create the environment, run the following command:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Running the project
If you want to replicate the results of this project, you can run each file separately. Each file contains the code to run the different methods for hiperparameter tuning for each model.

## Results
